# Arduino relay between RFM12b and ThingSpeak

This is a sketch for an Arduino pro mini attached to an RFM12b module. It operates in conjunction with the "rfm12b_thingspeak" sketch, which is running on an Arduino Uno with an Ethershield. The two Arduino's exchange sensor data over a i2c connection.
