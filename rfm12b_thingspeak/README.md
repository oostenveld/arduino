# Arduino relay between RFM12b and ThingSpeak

This is a sketch for an Arduino Uno with an Ethershield. It operates in conjunction with the "rfm12b_recv_xxxx" sketch, which is running on an Arduino pro mini with a RFM12b module attached. The two Arduino's exchange sensor data over a i2c connection.
